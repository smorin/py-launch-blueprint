    # Global Exclusion
    # If you want to exclude py_launch_blueprint/_version.py from all pre-commit hooks,
    # you can use a global exclusion at the top level of your configuration:
    # text
    # exclude: '^py_launch_blueprint/_version\.py$' # This is the global exclusion

    #   hooks:
    #   - id: end-of-file-fixer

    # Hook-Level Exclusion (Recommended Approach)
    # For your specific case where the end-of-file-fixer hook is modifying
    # py_launch_blue/print_version.py, the most targeted solution is to add an exclusion
    # at the hook level. This approach allows you to exclude the file from only the
    # problematic hook while maintaining checks for other hooks that might be beneficial.
