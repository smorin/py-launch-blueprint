## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Contributors

This project uses [COG (Cocogitto)](https://github.com/cocogitto/cocogitto) to automatically track and maintain our [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file. The list of contributors is automatically updated when:

1. A push is made to the main branch
2. A pull request is merged
3. Manually using the `just contributors` command

### Manual Update

To manually update the contributors list:

```bash
just contributors
```

### How Contributors are Tracked

Contributors are tracked based on git commit history. The system:
- Counts commits per contributor
- Shows contribution statistics
- Excludes certain email domains (e.g., noreply.github.com)
- Sorts contributors by number of commits

For more details about COG's contributor tracking, see the [official documentation](https://docs.cocogitto.io/).

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can accept your contributions, you will need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This is a legal document in which you state that you are entitled to contribute the code you are submitting and that you grant us the rights to use that contribution.

### How to Sign the CLA

1. **Individual Contributors**: If you are contributing as an individual, please sign the [Individual CLA](docs/cla/individual_cla.md).
2. **Corporate Contributors**: If you are contributing on behalf of a company, please sign the [Corporate CLA](docs/cla/corporate_cla.md).

### CLA Assistant Bot

We have integrated the CLA Assistant bot to streamline the CLA signing process. When you open a pull request, the bot will check if you have signed the CLA. If you have not, it will provide a link to sign it.

# Conventional Commits and Changelog

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages, which enables automatic changelog generation and version management using [Cocogitto (cog)](https://github.com/cocogitto/cocogitto).

## Commit Message Format

Commit messages must follow this format:
```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Common types include:
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting changes (white-space, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without feature changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Test additions or corrections
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Using the Changelog

The project automatically generates a changelog from conventional commits. To generate or update the changelog manually:

```bash
just changelog
```

## Versioning

The project uses semantic versioning based on conventional commits. To bump the version:

```bash
just bump         # Auto-detects version bump type based on commits
just bump patch   # For a patch version bump
just bump minor   # For a minor version bump
just bump major   # For a major version bump
```

## Commit Validation

To ensure your commits follow the conventional format, you can:

1. Use the interactive commit tool: `just commit`
2. Validate recent commits: `just verify-commits`
3. Install the pre-commit hook: `just setup-cog-hooks`

For more details, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

# Project Structure

The project uses a simple, maintainable structure:

```
py-utils/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ projects.py      # Main script with all functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/          # Test files
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_api.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_config.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_cli.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml  # Project and tool configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md      # Documentation
```
# Versioning and Release Management

This project uses automatic version management powered by Git tags and `setuptools_scm`. The version is dynamically generated during installation and build processes.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Versioning**: Version derived from Git tags (e.g., `v1.2.3` ‚Üí `1.2.3`)
- **Development Versions**: Unreleased commits show as `1.2.4.dev1+gabcdef12` (includes commit ID by default)
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions validate version-tag alignment
- **Semantic Versioning**: Enforces proper version format in tags
- **Customizable Local Scheme**: Control how development versions are formatted (e.g., include/exclude commit ID)

## Setup & Dependency Check
```bash
make check
```
