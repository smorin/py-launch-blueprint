## Complete Feature List

### Development Tools

- **Bootstrap dependency check and install with `make`**: Execute common development tasks with simple commands, standardizing workflows across team members.

- **Command running with `just`**: Define and run project-specific commands with a modern Make alternative, simplifying complex operations with clear syntax.

- **Linting with `ruff`**: Catch errors and enforce code style at lightning speed (10-100x faster than traditional linters), reducing waiting time and improving developer productivity.

- **Type checking with `mypy`**: Prevent type-related bugs before they occur, making your codebase more robust and easier to maintain as it grows.

- **Formatting with `ruff`**: Ensure consistent code style across your project automatically, eliminating style debates and pull request revision cycles.

- **Pre-commit hooks with `pre-commit`**: Enforce quality standards before code enters your repository, preventing bad code from ever being committed and reducing technical debt.

- **TOML formatting and validation with `taplo`**: Verify Toml files for syntax correctness, maintain consistent configuration files, ensuring readability and avoiding syntax errors in critical project settings.

- **YAML validation with `[TODO:tool under evaluation](https://github.com/smorin/py-launch-blueprint/issues/161)`**: Verify YAML files for syntax correctness, preventing configuration errors and deployment failures.

### Project Structure & Management

- **Project configuration with `pyproject.toml`**: Organize all project settings in one standardized location, simplifying maintenance and configuration.

- **Dependency groups separation**: Organize dependencies into main, dev, and doc categories, preventing bloated installations and clarifying requirements as part of `pyproject.toml` configuration.

- **Dependency management with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**: Install and manage packages at blazing speed (100x faster than pip/poetry), dramatically reducing environment setup time.

- **Build system with `hatchling`**: Streamline package building with modern Python packaging standards, ensuring compatibility and distribution consistency.

- **Versioning with `setuptools-scm`**: Automatically derive version numbers from git tags, eliminating manual version tracking and ensuring consistency.

- **Copyright license automation**: Automatically add license headers to all files, ensuring legal compliance without manual effort.

### Documentation

- **Documentation with `sphinx + MyST`**: Generate comprehensive documentation that supports both reStructuredText and Markdown, improving contributor accessibility.

- **`Read the Docs` integration**: Deploy documentation automatically, providing instant hosting and versioning for your project's documentation.

- **Changelog management with `cog`**: Track and communicate changes effectively to users and team members, improving project transparency and adoption.

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Testing framework with `pytest`**: Write and run tests with a modern, powerful testing framework that supports fixtures and parameterization.

- **CI/CD with `GitHub Actions`**: Automatically test, build, and deploy your project on multiple Python versions, catching compatibility issues early.

- **Matrix testing with `GitHub Actions`**: Run tests across multiple Python versions and operating systems, ensuring broad compatibility.

- **Simplified debugging info with `just debug-info`**: Automatically collect and format essential system, tool, and dependency information for streamlined bug reporting via a simple command.

### GitHub Integration

- **Pull request template**: Guide contributors through the PR process with structured information requirements, improving submission quality.

- **Issue templates (Feature, Bug, Documentation)**: Standardize issue reporting with appropriate fields for each type, gathering all necessary information upfront.

- **Automated contributor recognition with `cog`**: Automatically update contributor lists with cog, acknowledging all project participants without manual tracking.

- **Conventional commits support with `cog`**: Enforce structured commit messages, enabling automated changelog generation and version management.

- **Security policy**: Establish clear vulnerability reporting procedures, promoting responsible disclosure and faster security fixes.

- **Code of conduct**: Set community behavior expectations, fostering an inclusive and respectful project environment.
