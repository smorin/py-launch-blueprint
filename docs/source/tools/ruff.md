Ruff is a high-performance linter and code formatter for Python. It combines multiple tools into one, offering faster performance and comprehensive functionality compared to traditional Python tools.
**Pros**:

- ðŸš€ **Very Fast**: Written in Rust, Ruff is significantly faster than traditional linters, allowing it to process large codebases quickly.
-  ðŸ›  **All-in-One Solution**: Ruff incorporates checks and fixes from a variety of popular linters like Flake8, Black, isort, pydocstyle, pyupgrade, autoflake. This means less maintenance of multiple separate tools.
- âš™ **Customizable**: Allows users to select and ignore specific checks or enforce particular rules according to the project needs.
- ðŸ”— **Easy Integration**: Works well with CI/CD pipelines, IDEs, and modern developer workflows.
- ðŸ”„ **Automated Fixes**: Ruff can automatically correct a wide range of issues in your code.

**Cons**:
- **Relatively New**: As a newer tool, it might not yet be as widely adopted or supported in some edge cases.

Python line length standards:
- 79/80: Traditional PEP 8 standard. Good for side-by-side editing but can feel restrictive.
- 88: Black's default. Modern sweet spot between readability and expressiveness. Becoming the community standard.
- 100: Google's choice. Popular in enterprise. Good for complex expressions.
- 120: Maximum reasonable length. Works on wide screens but can hurt readability.
- Recommendation: Use 88 characters (Black's default) unless your team/project has an existing standard. It offers the best balance of readability and practicality while following modern community practices.

```pyproject.toml

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88

[tool.ruff.pycodestyle]
max-line-length = 88
```
