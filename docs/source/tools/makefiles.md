# Makefile

A `Makefile` is a simple text file used by the `make` build automation tool to manage dependencies and automate the compilation of programs. It defines a set of rules to follow in order to compile and link the program. The `make` tool uses these rules to decide how to build and update executables, libraries, and other files in a project.

## Basic Structure
A `Makefile` consists of:
1. **Targets** – The files that need to be created.
2. **Dependencies** – The files that a target depends on.
3. **Commands** – The shell commands that make will run to create the target.

### General Syntax:
```
target: dependencies
    command
```

- `target`: The file to be created or updated (often the executable or object files).
- `dependencies`: Files that are required to build the target.
- `command`: A shell command to execute. Commands are usually preceded by a tab (not spaces).

This project uses two Makefiles for different purposes:

1. **Project Root Makefile (`Makefile`)**

   - Used to install essential dependencies for development.
   - Handles basic setup tasks.
   - Primarily serves as a bootstrap for initializing the development environment.

2. **Documentation Makefile (`docs/Makefile`)**
   - Auto-generated by the `sphinx-quickstart` command.
   - Used for building project documentation.
   - Should not be called directly; instead, use the `just` file to execute documentation-related commands.

## Usage

The primary Makefile in the root directory is used to set up the development environment. Typical commands include:

```sh
make check   		# To check system requirements
make install-just	# To print the install the 'just' command
make install-just-force	# To forcibly reinstall the 'just' command runner
make install-uv     	# To print the install the 'uv' tool command
make install-uv-force	# To forcibly reinstall the 'uv' tool
```

### Force Installing Core Dependencies

If you encounter issues with `just` or `uv`, or if you want to ensure you have the very latest version, you can use the `force` variants of the installation commands:

-   `make install-just-force`: This command runs the official `just` installation script. It will install `just` to `~/bin` and automatically add this directory to your PATH in `~/.zshenv` if it's not already there.

-   `make install-uv-force`: Similarly, this command runs the official `uv` installation script. It will install `uv` and ensure it's properly configured in your environment.

These commands are part of the main `Makefile` in the project root, designed to help bootstrap your development environment. After running any installation command, especially a force install, ensure the tool's installation directory (e.g., `~/bin` for `just`, `~/.local/bin` for `uv`) is correctly configured in your system's `PATH`.
