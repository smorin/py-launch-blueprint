# Project Philosophy

Py Launch Blueprint is built on core principles to ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable Python project template.

## Philosophy
- **Heavily Documented**: Every detail is explained, making it easy to understand, even for folks new to the project, tools, or new to Python.
- **Pragmatic**: Focuses on practical best practices instead of strict rules
- **Modular**: Designed to be easy to remove features, replace with alternatives or add new ones

## Why Open Source?

- **Transparent**: Every detail is documented, making it easy to understand and contribute
- **Collaborative**: A community of developers is formed, fostering a shared learning environment

## Vision

To be the go-to Python project template, continuously evolving with community feedback and modern best practices.
