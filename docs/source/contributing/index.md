## Tracking Contributors
This project uses [COG (Cocogitto)](https://github.com/cocogitto/cocogitto) to track contributors automatically in [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](https://github.com/smorin/py-launch-blueprint/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md). The list updates when:
1. A push is made to the main branch.
2. A pull request is merged.

   ```

### How Contributors are Tracked

Contributors are tracked based on git commit history. The system:
- Counts commits per contributor
- Shows contribution statistics
- Excludes certain email domains (e.g., noreply.github.com)
- Sorts contributors by number of commits

For more details about COG's contributor tracking, see the [official documentation](https://docs.cocogitto.io/).
