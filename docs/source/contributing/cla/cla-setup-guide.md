## Testing the CLA Setup

To ensure that the CLA Assistant is working as expected, follow this comprehensive testing procedure.

### 1. Test Very First-Time CLA Flow

- Create a **new pull request** from a test account or this setup branch.
- Verify:
  - The **CLA Assistant bot** posts a comment on the PR requesting signature.
  - The **CLA status badge** (in PR checks) shows as **pending** or **failed**.

### 2. Sign the CLA

- In the bot‚Äôs comment, click the **‚ÄúSign CLA‚Äù** link.
- Complete the signing flow on [cla-assistant.io](https://cla-assistant.io).
- Refresh the PR page.

### 3. Validate Signing Behavior

- Confirm that:
  - The CLA status badge updates to **‚Äúsuccess‚Äù** (green checkmark).
  - The bot **updates the comment** to confirm CLA has been signed.

### 4. Test CLA Persistence

- Create another **new pull request** from the same GitHub account that already signed the CLA.
- Confirm that:
  - The bot **does not ask to sign again**.
  - The CLA status badge is **immediately green (success)** without further action.

---

### Submit a Test Pull Request

Ask a team member (or yourself) to open a pull request.

If the contributor hasn't signed the CLA:

- CLA Assistant will comment on the PR with a signature request.

Once signed, CLA Assistant will:

- Post a confirmation message.
- Mark the CLA check as completed.

---

### Monitor CLA Status

- Use the CLA Assistant dashboard to see contributors who have signed.
- View, track, and manage CLA signatories easily.
