# CI/CD Automation Process

This document explains the CI/CD automation process used in the Py Launch Blueprint project.

## Overview

The CI/CD process is designed to ensure code quality, security, and reliability by automating the testing, linting, type checking, and deployment of the project. The process is implemented using GitHub Actions workflows.

## Workflows

### CI Workflow

The CI workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` file. It runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch and includes the following jobs:

- **Test**: Runs the test suite using `pytest`.
- **Lint**: Checks code style and quality using `ruff`.
- **Type Check**: Runs type checking using `mypy`.
- **Security**: Checks for vulnerabilities using `Safety CLI`.

### CodeQL Workflow

The CodeQL workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` file. It runs on every push and pull request to the `main` branch and on a weekly schedule. It performs static analysis to identify security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.

### Dependency Review Workflow

The Dependency Review workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` file. It runs on every pull request to the `main` branch and checks for known-vulnerable versions of the packages declared or updated in the pull request.

### Release Workflow

The Release workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/release.yml` file. It runs on every push to a tag that matches the pattern `v*` and publishes the package to PyPI.

## Configuration

### GitHub Actions

The GitHub Actions workflows are configured using YAML files located in the `.github/workflows` directory. Each workflow file defines the events that trigger the workflow, the jobs to be run, and the steps within each job.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure the workflows. Sensitive information, such as API keys and tokens, should be stored as secrets in the GitHub repository settings.

### Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed using `uv` and are specified in the `pyproject.toml` file. The `[project.optional-dependencies.docs]` section includes the dependencies required for building the documentation.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Workflows Simple**: Break down complex workflows into smaller, manageable jobs.
- **Use Caching**: Cache dependencies and build artifacts to speed up workflow execution.
- **Fail Fast**: Configure workflows to fail fast and provide clear error messages.
- **Secure Secrets**: Store sensitive information as secrets and avoid hardcoding them in the workflow files.
- **Monitor and Maintain**: Regularly monitor the workflows and update them as needed to ensure they remain effective and efficient.

## Conclusion

The CI/CD automation process in the Py Launch Blueprint project is designed to ensure code quality, security, and reliability. By leveraging GitHub Actions workflows, the process automates testing, linting, type checking, and deployment, making it easier for contributors to maintain and improve the project.
