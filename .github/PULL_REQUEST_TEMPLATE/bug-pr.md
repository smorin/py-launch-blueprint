## Bug Description
<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of the bug being fixed -->
<!-- Example: Users were unable to log in when using special characters in their passwords due to improper character escaping -->

## Root Cause

<!-- Example: The password validation function was not properly escaping special characters before hashing, causing the comparison to fail even with correct passwords -->

## Fix Implementation
<!-- Describe how you fixed the bug -->
<!-- Example: 
- Added proper escaping of special characters in the password validation function
- Updated the authentication flow to use the fixed validation function
- Added additional validation to prevent similar issues in the future
-->

<!-- Include both automated and manual testing -->
<!-- Example: 
- Added unit tests specifically for special character handling in passwords
- Manually tested login with various special characters
- Verified fix works across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Added regression tests to prevent future occurrences

## Reviewer Notes
<!-- Any specific areas that need careful review or explanation -->
<!-- Highlight complex parts or areas where you're seeking feedback -->
